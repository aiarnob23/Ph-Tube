                JavaScript has three variable declaration statements: var, let and const. The latter two were added in
                ES6, whereas var existed since previous versions. One of the first things to notice is that const
                defines constants (i.e. values that will not be reassigned), whereas var and let define variables. Yet,
                var behaves differently from both let and const in various other ways.<br><br>
                The <strong>var</strong> declaration has some confusing properties when it comes to scope. In
                JavaScript, the var statement declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable, optionally
                initializing it to a value. The scope of a variable declared with var is one of the following:
                Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope, meaning that they can be used before
                they are declared . However, it is considered best practice to declare variables at the beginning of
                their scope to avoid confusion and bugs .<br>
                <span class="font-bold">example code in JavaScript:</span><br>
                <span class="text-gray-500">// Global variable declared with 'var'<br>
                    var globalVar = "I'm a global variable";<br>
                    function exampleFunction() {<br>
                    // Local variable declared with 'var' within a function<br>
                    var localVar = "I'm a local variable";<br>
                    if (true) {<br>
                    // 'var' variables are function-scoped, so 'if' block doesn't create a new scope<br>
                    var blockVar = "I'm a 'var' variable inside an 'if' block";<br>
                    }<br>
                    // 'globalVar' and 'localVar' are accessible here<br>
                    console.log(globalVar); // Outputs: I'm a global variable<br>
                    console.log(localVar); // Outputs: I'm a local variable<br>
                    console.log(blockVar); // Outputs: I'm a 'var' variable inside an 'if' block<br>
                    }<br>
                    exampleFunction();<br>
                    // 'globalVar' is accessible outside the function scope<br>
                    console.log(globalVar); // Outputs: I'm a global variable<br>
                    // 'localVar' and 'blockVar' are not accessible here<br>
                    console.log(localVar); // Throws an error: localVar is not defined<br>
                    console.log(blockVar); // Throws an error: blockVar is not defined</span>
                <br><br>
                On the other hand, <strong>const</strong> has cleaner scoping rules and usually should be preferred.
                Variables declared with const are block-scoped, which means they are only accessible within the block in
                which they are defined (e.g., within a function or loop).
                A const variable cannot be reassigned a new value once it is declared, but it doesn't necessarily make
                the value itself immutable. For example, if you declare a const object, you can still modify its
                properties.<br>
                <span class="font-bold">example code in JavaScript:</span><br>
                <span class="text-gray-500">// Global constant declared with 'const'<br>
                    const globalConst = "I'm a global constant";<br>
                    function exampleFunction() {<br>
                    // Local constant declared with 'const' within a function<br>
                    const localConst = "I'm a local constant";<br>
                    if (true) {<br>
                    // 'const' variables are block-scoped<br>
                    const blockConst = "I'm a 'const' variable inside an 'if' block";<br>
                    }<br>
                    // 'globalConst' and 'localConst' are accessible here<br>
                    console.log(globalConst); // Outputs: I'm a global constant<br>
                    console.log(localConst); // Outputs: I'm a local constant<br>
                    // 'blockConst' is not accessible here<br>
                    console.log(blockConst); // Throws an error: blockConst is not defined<br>
                    }<br>
                    exampleFunction();<br>
                    // 'globalConst' is accessible outside the function scope<br>
                    console.log(globalConst); // Outputs: I'm a global constant<br>
                    // 'localConst' and 'blockConst' are not accessible here<br>
                    console.log(localConst); // Throws an error: localConst is not defined<br>
                    console.log(blockConst); // Throws an error: blockConst is not defined</span>
                <br><br>
                Variables declared with <strong>let</strong> are also block-scoped like const. This means they are
                accessible only within the block in
                which they are declared, such as loops, conditional statements, or function blocks.
                Variables declared with let can be reassigned new values within their scope.
                Variables declared with let are not hoisted to the top of their scope, meaning that they cannot be used
                before they are declared. This is known as the temporal dead zone. It is considered best practice to
                declare variables at the beginning of their scope to avoid confusion and bugs .<br>
                <span class="font-bold">example code in JavaScript:</span><br>
                <span class="text-gray-500">function example() {<br>
                    let x = 10;<br>
                    if (true) {<br>
                    let x = 20; // This 'x' is a different variable with block scope.<br>
                    console.log(x); // Outputs 20<br>
                    }<br>
                    console.log(x); // Outputs 10<br>
                    }</span>
                <br><br>
                In modern JavaScript, it's generally recommended to use let and const over var because they provide
                better scoping control and reduce the potential for bugs. Use let when you need a variable that can be
                reassigned, and use const when you want to create a constant that should not be reassigned.

            <p

                In JavaScript, null and undefined are two distinct values that are used to represent the absence of a
                value . The difference between them is that undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet
                been assigned a value, while null is an assignment value that represents no value.<br><br>
                Use <strong>null</strong> when you want to explicitly indicate that a variable has no value .null is
                explicitly assigned to variables or properties to represent the intentional absence of any object value.
                It is often used to indicate that a variable should hold no value or that an object property has no
                assigned value.<br>For example, if you have a variable that stores a user’s middle name, but the user
                doesn’t have one, you can set the variable to null.<br>Developers may use null to clear the value of an
                object property, indicating that the property should not hold a reference to any object. <br>Developers
                may use null to check if a particular value has been intentionally set as absent.<br><br>
                Use <strong>undefined</strong> when you haven’t assigned a value to a variable yet . For example, if you
                declare a variable but don’t assign it a value, it will be undefined.<br>
                In JavaScript, when you declare a variable without assigning a value to it, it automatically receives
                the value undefined. This is often used as the default value for variables that haven't been given a
                meaningful value yet.<br>
                If a function is called with fewer arguments than declared in its parameter list, the missing parameters
                are assigned the value undefined.<br>
                When you access an object property that doesn't exist, JavaScript returns undefined.
                <br><br>
                In summary, undefined typically represents the absence of an expected value due to a variable being
                uninitialized, a function parameter missing an argument, or an object property not existing. On the
                other hand, null is used to explicitly indicate the absence of any object value, and it can be assigned
                to variables and object properties when you want to clear or signify the absence of a value.

            <p
                class="text-2xl bg-orange-50  h-[600px]  px-2 py-3 md:px-5  font-medium overflow-scroll overflow-x-hidden leading-10">
                A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state
                transfer architectural style. REST APIs provide a flexible, lightweight way to integrate applications
                and to connect components in microservices architectures .<br>
                At the most basic level, an API is a mechanism that enables an application or service to access a
                resource within another application or service. The application or service doing the accessing is called
                the client, and the application or service containing the resource is called the server<br><br>
                A REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a
                standardized approach to building web services that allow different software applications to communicate
                over the internet or a network. REST APIs are designed based on a set of architectural principles,
                making them simple, scalable, and easy to understand. In a REST API, resources, such as data objects or
                services, are represented as unique URLs, and clients interact with these resources using standard HTTP
                methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. RESTful APIs follow a stateless communication model, meaning
                that each request from a client to a server contains all the information needed, and the server does not
                retain any client state between requests. This design promotes modularity, uniformity, and separation of
                concerns, making REST APIs a popular choice for building web and mobile applications, connecting to
                external services, and facilitating interoperability between different software systems.
